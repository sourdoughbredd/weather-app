# weather-app

A simple weather app to practice working with APIs and asynchronous Javascript.

### Dev Notes

If the design looks familiar to you, it's because I went with a clone of the Apple weather app on iPhone so that i wouldn't get bogged down in making design choices. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the result and how quickly I was able to complete it. Working with the Weather API introduced some new challenges, including careful handling of time zone differences and handling of errors returned by the API. The only issue I have with the app currently is that the daily forecast elements don't always align (in space) nicely. This could be fixed pretty easily with some refactoring, but my time is better spent on continuing my learning.
